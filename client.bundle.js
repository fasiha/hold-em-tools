  // different layout, where the child points to a dehydrated fragment, which
  // contains the DOM rendered by the server.
  //
  // Third, even if you set all that aside, Suspense is like error boundaries in

        //
        // If we hit a "Delayed" case, such as when we'd switch from content back into
        // a fallback, then we should always suspend/restart. Transitions apply
        // to this case. If none is defined, JND is used instead.

        // then we suspend/restart for 500ms since the last time we showed a fallback
        // anywhere in the tree. This effectively throttles progressive loading into a
        // consistent train of commits. This also gives us an opportunity to restart to
        // get to the completed state slightly earlier.
        //

# hold-em-tools

## Installation
Ensure you have both [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then run the following set of commands in your command-line prompt  (i.e., Terminal in macOS, xterm in Linux, Command Prompt in Windows, etc.), noting that the `$` symbol just indicates the start of the prompt and is not intended to be typed.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/fasiha/hold-em-tools.git
$ cd hold-em-tools
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```
The `git` command comes from the eponymous program you have installed, while `npm` was installed by Node.js.

## Run
```
$ node skinnyRank.js 7
$ node histogramBinfile.js --max-old-space-size=4096 2 3 4 5 6
$ node server.js
$ node deal.js 0 # run this in another tab
```
This will:
1. first generate a 1.1 GB file, `handsScore-7.bin`, containing all 134 million seven-card hands as well as the best ranking (one through ten, one for royal flush, ten for high card)â€”so eight bytes time 133784560 divided by 1024 bytes per kilobyte, and divided by 1024 kilobytes per megabyte yields 1020 megabytes.
2. Then generate five files, named `map-r-7-n-2.ldjson`, `map-r-7-n-3.ldjson`, and so on through `map-r-7-n-6.ldjson`, i.e., the "n" number goes from 2 to 6. These line-delimited JSON files (where each line is valid JSON) contains each "n"-card hand for "n" running from 2 to 6 (inclusive), and the total number of royal flushes, straight flushes, etc., that can be made with those "n" cards out of the universe of seven-card hands. The "n" = 2 file contains 52-choose-2, or 1326, rows. The "n" = 6 file contains 52-choose-6, or more than twenty million, rows.
1. Because of some [internal limitations](https://stackoverflow.com/q/54452896/500207) in Node.js, it's necessary to use a secondary database mapping each 2- to 6-card hand to the frequency table of how often each card is part of a royal flush, straight flush, etc. (for all ten rankings of poker hands). This step puts all that information inside Leveldb and serves this data as a webserver.
1. Finally, **in another terminal**, the last script will deal four players seven cards, rank them best to worst, and show you some histogram analysis of each hand.

N.B. If you run `$ node deal.js 0` several times, you'll see the exact same deal. If you want to shuffle and redeal, change the `0` to another number: this number is the random seed.

Currently, the final printout of the program results in the following Markdown:
